# Keylogger
Please note that this file is a keylogger and can be considered malicious in nature. So to test it, it is important that you turn off antivirus
After that you can put your own information in the email address section and run it. Files are created automatically in this code. It is recommended that
you use a specific email and allow login from less secure networks in its settings. Again, I highly recommend not to use personal email.

This code captures screenshots after each iteration in time (5s for example), captures keylogs, captures clipboard and sends everything in the form of emails
